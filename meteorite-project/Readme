Requirements:
1. pandas, reverse_geocoder and requests[security]. Required packages can be installed using pip.
2. python 3+

How to test code:
1. After the project zip file is extracted, change current directory to folder named meteorite-project in the extracted file.
2. From meteorite-project folder, execute following command "python meteorite-project.py" to run the program.
3. After the execution of above command, the console statements will provide answers for questions from one to four.

Answer to Question 5 Can you infer anything from this data? Why or why not?
From the meteorite data of 2008 and 2010 we can tell that meteorite seen correlates to densely populated regions. However
we need to further analyze the complete data set to be 100% sure. Additionally, we can say that countries which are densely populated
are doing more research in meteorite to avoid any causalities.

Please refer to project_x document for proposed model for anomaly detection.
